					I'm a software developer based in Fort Worth, Texas, with a passion for technology and
					innovation. I hold a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from the University of
					Texas at Arlington. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've developed a
					strong foundation in software development, problem-solving, and emerging technologies.
					When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends and
					exploring new tools that push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital world.
					I'm always eager to take on new challenges that allow me to grow and make a meaningful
					impact.
